# Android cross-compile environment #

To make it easy to do autotools and cmake builds with the android NDK, the `env-android.sh` shell script sets up a cross-compile environment. You need to edit the `env-android.sh` script and set `XENV_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` to the path of the toolchain generated by NDK's `make-standalone-toolchain.sh` script.  
Then source this script in your shell:  
`source /path/to/karere/platforms/android/env-android.sh`   
It should print instructions how to use it with autotools and cmake.
All autotools and cmake builds done in this environment will install under the `$XENV_TOOLCHAIN_PATH/sysroot` prefix (in case `make install` is issued). All dependencies will be searched for in that prefix. In other words, this is the android cross-compile sysroot.
